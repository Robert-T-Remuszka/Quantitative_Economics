    "# Intro to Dynamic Programming\n",
    "**Overview.** This lecture covers basic concepts from Dynamic Programming. The exposition follows Adda and Cooper (2003).<sup>1</sup> A more in depth treatment can be found in Stokey and Lucas (1989).<sup>2</sup>\n",

    "Let $\\tilde\\sigma(s_t,c_t)$ denote the payoff to an agent. $s_t$ is a state vector which is a set of variables that affect payoffs but that the agent has no influence over contemporaneously. The agent can choose the control $c_t$ to influence the *evolution* of the state through the transition equation $s_{t+1} = \\tau(s_t,c_t)$. Letting $V(s_0)$ denote the maximized value of\n",
